\title{Computation of FLOD scores}
\usage{
setFLOD(submaps, condition, q = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{submaps}{a atlas object}

\item{condition}{A vector containing a list of individuals. Only this list of individuals will have their FLOD scores computed}

\item{q}{Allows the user to choose the assumed frequency of the mutation involved in the disease for each individual. Default is 0.0001.}
}
\value{
the atlas object with each FLOD.prob slot of each submaps in the slot submaps_list computed
}
\description{
This function is uses to compute FLOD scores on individual present in a sample
}
\details{
This function iterates over the slots submaps_list of the atlas object.

For each submaps in the slots submaps_list of the object, the slot FLOD.prob will be filled with a matrix of dimension : number_inidividual x number_of_markers
